Solving for y value:
call method to ask the user for their x value
call method to ask the user for their slope value
call method to ask the user for their y intercept value
return calculations to user
ask them if they want to run the program again

Solving for slope value:
call method to ask the user for their x value
call method to ask the user for their y value

Solving for slope using 2 points on a grid:
call method to ask the user for their first x value
call method to ask the user for their second x value
call method to ask the user for their first y value
call method to ask the user for their second y value
check if the user is attempting to divide by 0 and stop them
return calculations to user
ask them if they want to run the program again

if they say no, display goodbye message
