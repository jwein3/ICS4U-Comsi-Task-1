method for getting variables:
for(each variable needed)
  Scanner class for input
  while(the user doesn't implement a proper value)
      ask them for a user input
      display message telling them to enter a proper value
  return value gotten from method

main program
define all variables needed for math calculations
define a string value for user input
create a new scanner for user input
define a new boolean that loops the program and set it to true
print out all options to the user
get user input
while(program loop boolean is true) 
 case/switch(program they chose to run)
      case 1: 
        solve for y value by calling the methods to get the values to solve for y, then return it to the user
      case 2: 
        solve for x value by calling the methods to get the values to solve for x, then return it to the user
      case 3: 
        solve for y intercept value by calling the methods to get the values to solve for y intercept, then return it to the user
      case 4: 
        solve for slope value by calling the methods to get the values to solve for slope, then return it to the user
      case 5: 
        solve for slope using 2 points by calling the methods to get the 2 points needed to solve for slope , then return it to the user
       default:
         print out that the user inputted an invalid statemnet
    
   ask the user if they want to run the program again
      if yes
        run the program again
      if no 
        stop the program and display the goodbye message
